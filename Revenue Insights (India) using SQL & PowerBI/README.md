## Sales Insights using SQL & Power BI
### About the Project
This project involves analyzing sales data using SQL for data cleaning and exploration, followed by data visualization using Power BI. The dataset includes various details such as customer information, product transactions, market-wise sales, and date-wise performance. The goal of this project is to uncover insights into sales trends, regional performance, and revenue contribution.

### Technologies Used
The project is built using the following technologies:

SQL: For data cleaning, transformation, and analytical queries.

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing sales performance.

Microsoft SQL Server: Used to store and query the data.

### Project Description
In this project, a structured sales database containing tables like Customers, Date, Markets, Products, and Transactions was used. SQL was employed to clean the data, remove unnecessary columns, and create meaningful summaries. Key analytical queries were written to understand trends, revenue patterns, and product performance across different markets and time periods.

After cleaning and exploring the data in SQL, Power BI was used to build a visual dashboard that highlights key business insights, allowing for quick and effective decision-making.

### SQL Query Highlights

Retrieved date ranges and currency distributions

Calculated year-wise revenue (2019 and 2020)

Analyzed market-wise sales quantities and revenue contributions

Categorized product sales by quantity

Determined the top-performing markets

### Power BI Dashboard
The cleaned and processed data was connected to Power BI for visualization. The dashboard showcases:

Year-on-year sales trends

Profit analysis by region

Monthly sales distribution

High-performing markets and products

### Key Insights
Sales dropped significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, with a decrease of around 57.7%.
