## Disney Movie Data Analysis using PySpark



### About the Project

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Disney movies using PySpark. The dataset includes various features such as IMDb ratings, release year, genre, runtime, language, director, and cast. The aim is to perform data cleaning, transformation, and exploration to extract meaningful insights about Disney’s movie production and performance.



### Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

1. PySpark: For distributed data processing and analysis of large datasets

2\. Python: For writing the data processing scripts

3\. Jupyter Notebook: Used as the development environment for running and testing PySpark code



### Project Description

The project uses PySpark DataFrame API to analyze and manipulate Disney movie data. Data preprocessing steps such as handling null values, filtering records, and renaming columns are performed. A series of analytical queries were executed to explore trends in ratings, release patterns, genres, and more.

This project demonstrates the use of PySpark for large-scale data analysis and highlights its ability to efficiently process complex queries over structured datasets.



### PySpark Query Highlights

Identified the top 10 highest-rated Disney movies based on average IMDb ratings

Found the Disney movie with the highest average rating

Listed the 10 lowest-rated Disney movies, excluding those with null ratings

Calculated the average IMDb rating for each director and sorted them in ascending order

Counted the number of movies released each year and sorted the results in descending order

Analyzed the most common movie genres

Identified the longest and shortest runtime movies

Explored the distribution of languages across Disney movies

Found the most frequent directors and writers in the dataset

Counted the number of movies associated with each actor or actress



### Key Insights

Some directors consistently produce high-rated movies, reflecting strong creative direction

The highest number of movies were released during peak years of Disney’s expansion

IMDb ratings revealed both standout successes and underperforming titles

English dominates the language distribution, but other languages also appear across global releases

Certain markets and franchises influence the volume and nature of Disney’s movie output
